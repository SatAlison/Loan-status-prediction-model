## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the status of loans based on historical data. It involves analyzing various factors that influence whether a loan will be fully paid, defaulted, or charged off.

## Motivation and Objectives
The main motivation is to help financial institutions assess loan risk more accurately. By predicting loan statuses, lenders can better manage their portfolios, reduce losses, and provide better loan offers to clients.

The objectives include:
- Analyzing historical loan data.
- Identifying key factors contributing to loan default.
- Building a predictive model to forecast loan outcomes.

## Data Sources and Timeline
The dataset used in this project contains records of past loans, including demographic information, loan details, and borrower profiles. The timeline for the project spans several phases, from data exploration to model deployment.

Key columns in the dataset:
- Loan Amount
- Interest Rate
- Employment Length
- Annual Income
- Loan Status (target variable)

## Tools
The following tools and libraries were used for data analysis, model development, and visualization:
- **Python** for coding.
- **Pandas** for data manipulation.
- **NumPy** for numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive code development.

## Steps Taken / Project Workflow

### Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values in key columns like `Employment Length`, `Annual Income`, and `Interest Rate`.
- Normalized and standardized numerical variables for consistent analysis.
- Categorical variables such as loan status were encoded to be used in machine learning models.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Explored distributions of key features such as loan amount, interest rate, and borrower income.
- Visualized relationships between borrower attributes and loan outcomes to identify patterns.
  
### Correlation Analysis
- Performed correlation analysis to understand the relationships between different variables and loan outcomes.
- Visualized correlations using heatmaps to detect highly correlated features.

### Data Visualization
- Created histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize the distribution of data.
- Used bar charts to display the proportion of loan status outcomes.

## Insights and Recommendations

### Key Findings
- Loan amount and interest rate significantly impact the likelihood of loan default.
- Borrowers with shorter employment history tend to default more frequently.
- Higher income borrowers are generally less likely to default.

### Recommendations
- Lenders should focus on offering more favorable rates to borrowers with stable employment.
- More detailed checks on borrower employment history could reduce the risk of default.
- Targeting higher-income borrowers could improve overall loan performance.

## Limitations
- The dataset may not account for economic changes or regulatory shifts over time, which could impact loan outcomes.
- Some data points, such as employment length, are self-reported, which might introduce bias.

## Impact and Future Plans
The model built in this project can significantly enhance a lenderâ€™s ability to predict loan defaults and optimize their lending strategies. Future improvements could involve:
- Adding more recent data to reflect current lending environments.
- Incorporating external data, such as credit scores or macroeconomic indicators, to improve model accuracy.
